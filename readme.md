# 📈 Finance Volatility & Return Testing using C Language

> A high-performance implementation of volatility and return calculations written in C, with a strong focus on deterministic testing and numerical accuracy.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Financial data analysis often relies on floating-point computations, where even the smallest rounding errors can propagate and significantly distort the final output. In this context, the **robustness and precision of our tests are not optional—they are critical**.

---

## ✅ Why Rigorous Testing Matters

- 🔢 **Floating-point instability**: Minor differences in numeric precision (e.g., between platforms or compilers) can lead to drastically different results.
- 📊 **Sensitivity to edge cases**: Extreme values (zero returns, flat markets, spikes in volatility) can break naïve calculations.
- 🧪 **Reproducibility**: In finance, even small discrepancies can affect risk models, portfolio decisions, and backtesting results. Accurate tests ensure consistent behavior.
- 📉 **Real-world impact**: Poor handling of numerical methods in production can lead to flawed investment strategies.

## 🔍 Testing Strategy

We designed our tests with the following principles in mind:

- 🧾 **Deterministic datasets**: Each test uses known inputs with mathematically verifiable outputs.
- 🔄 **Cross-platform reproducibility**: All results are consistent across different systems running the same compiler and architecture.
- 📐 **Tolerance-based comparisons**: For floating-point operations, we use epsilon-based comparisons to handle precision margins.
- 📚 **Documentation-first**: Each test case includes clear commentary explaining the expected behavior and any assumptions.

## 🧪 Key Tests and Their Rationale

### 1. 📈 Return Calculation Accuracy Test
- **What it tests:** ✅ Validates the correctness of the return calculation function against known datasets.
- **Why this test:** 🎯 Returns are the foundation of any financial analysis. Ensuring precise return calculations is critical because small errors can propagate and distort volatility estimates and portfolio risk assessments.
- **How it works:** 🔍 Uses pre-calculated expected return values and compares them with the function output using an epsilon-based tolerance to account for floating-point precision.

### 2. ⚡ Volatility Estimation Robustness Test
- **What it tests:** 🛡️ Evaluates the volatility calculation over diverse datasets, including volatile, flat, and extreme market conditions.
- **Why this test:** ⚠️ Volatility is sensitive to outliers and extreme values. This test ensures that the algorithm handles such edge cases gracefully without numerical instability or crashes.
- **How it works:** 🧪 Runs the volatility function on synthetic and historical data samples, verifying results fall within expected bounds and do not produce NaNs or infinities.

### 3. 🌐 Cross-Platform Consistency Test
- **What it tests:** 🔄 Confirms that results are consistent across different platforms and compiler settings.
- **Why this test:** 🖥️ Floating-point arithmetic can differ subtly between architectures or compiler optimizations. This test is essential to guarantee reproducibility and reliability of financial models regardless of the execution environment.
- **How it works:** ⚖️ Compares outputs from different machines or build configurations, flagging discrepancies beyond an acceptable error margin.

### 📋 Summary

By focusing on these three core tests, the project ensures:

- ✔️ **Mathematical correctness** in key financial metrics,
- 🛠️ **Robustness** against diverse and challenging datasets,
- 🔁 **Reproducibility** and reliability in various environments.

These choices reflect the critical nature of numerical precision and stability in financial computing.


## 💡 Key Design Decisions

- ⚙️ **C language for control & performance**: C offers low-level memory and computation control, which is ideal for benchmarking and optimization in numerical analysis.
- 🧮 **Custom math functions where needed**: When standard library functions exhibit instability or lack precision, custom implementations are used.
- 🧰 **Modular test architecture**: Tests are separated into logical units (e.g., return calculation, volatility estimation, error bounds) for clarity and maintainability.

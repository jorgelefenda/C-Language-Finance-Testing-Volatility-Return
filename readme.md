# 📈 Finance Volatility & Return Testing using C Language

> A high-performance implementation of volatility and return calculations written in C, with a strong focus on deterministic testing and numerical accuracy.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Financial data analysis often relies on floating-point computations, where even the smallest rounding errors can propagate and significantly distort the final output. In this context, the **robustness and precision of our tests are not optional—they are critical**.

---

## ✅ Why Rigorous Testing Matters

- 🔢 **Floating-point instability**: Minor differences in numeric precision (e.g., between platforms or compilers) can lead to drastically different results.
- 📊 **Sensitivity to edge cases**: Extreme values (zero returns, flat markets, spikes in volatility) can break naïve calculations.
- 🧪 **Reproducibility**: In finance, even small discrepancies can affect risk models, portfolio decisions, and backtesting results. Accurate tests ensure consistent behavior.
- 📉 **Real-world impact**: Poor handling of numerical methods in production can lead to flawed investment strategies.

## 🔍 Testing Strategy

We designed our tests with the following principles in mind:

- 🧾 **Deterministic datasets**: Each test uses known inputs with mathematically verifiable outputs.
- 🔄 **Cross-platform reproducibility**: All results are consistent across different systems running the same compiler and architecture.
- 📐 **Tolerance-based comparisons**: For floating-point operations, we use epsilon-based comparisons to handle precision margins.
- 📚 **Documentation-first**: Each test case includes clear commentary explaining the expected behavior and any assumptions.

## 🧪 Functional, Unit, and Integration Tests

To ensure precision and stability in this project, we implemented three fundamental types of tests, each serving a specific purpose:

---

### 1. 🧩 Unit Test  
- **What it tests:** Individual core functions such as return calculation or variance computation.  
- **Why:** Ensures each basic mathematical component works correctly in isolation, catching simple errors early before integration.  
- **How it was designed:** Uses small, controlled datasets with hand-calculated or trusted reference values, comparing results with epsilon-based tolerance for floating-point accuracy.  
- **Example:** Testing the function that calculates return between two points with simple values to verify correct formula implementation.

---

### 2. 🔍 Functional Test  
- **What it tests:** The complete behavior of a module, like volatility calculation from a series of returns.  
- **Why:** Verifies that components interact correctly and data flows as expected in representative scenarios.  
- **How it was designed:** Uses datasets with known characteristics (stable markets, volatile periods, outliers) to confirm outputs align with financial and statistical expectations.  
- **Example:** Running the full volatility function on real or simulated data and comparing the results against expected values within a small error margin.

---

### 3. 🔗 Integration Test  
- **What it tests:** Interaction between modules or functions that together form the complete system, including data input, calculations, and report generation.  
- **Why:** Ensures the entire system works seamlessly without errors, and that communication between parts is flawless.  
- **How it was designed:** Tests simulate real-world use cases from data ingestion to final output, validating consistency and absence of failures.  
- **Example:** Processing a full historical dataset to calculate returns and volatility, then verifying results against benchmarks or external calculations.

---

### 📌 Summary of Decisions

- **Unit tests** are strict, using small datasets to detect errors at the most fundamental level.  
- **Functional tests** handle more complex data to ensure modules perform correctly under various financial scenarios.  
- **Integration tests** validate the solution as a whole, simulating real usage flows to guarantee robustness and reliability.

This combined strategy is crucial due to the **delicate nature of numerical computations in finance**, where even minor inaccuracies or errors can impact critical decisions.

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

- ⚙️ **C language for control & performance**: C offers low-level memory and computation control, which is ideal for benchmarking and optimization in numerical analysis.
- 🧮 **Custom math functions where needed**: When standard library functions exhibit instability or lack precision, custom implementations are used.
- 🧰 **Modular test architecture**: Tests are separated into logical units (e.g., return calculation, volatility estimation, error bounds) for clarity and maintainability.
